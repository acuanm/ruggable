### Introduction
This is a react app that I created for an coding assignment from Ruggable. It uses the GitHub REST API and allows the user to search for a specific users repsoitory and display the results based on the number of stars the repository has. I used React.js and I used node-fetch to make http requests (link to download can be found here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch) 

### How to run
You will need to have React.js and node-fetched installed before you can run the program. Once these are installed, pull the project files for GitHub, open the terminal and in your command line, cd to the file that contains the project and run 'yarn start'. 

### Exiting the Progam
Once you are finished running the program, press the keys Control + C in the command line and the program should stop working
